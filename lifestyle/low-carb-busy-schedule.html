        <p>"I don't have time to cook." It's the most common excuse. But low-carb can actually be <em>faster</em> than
            normal cooking because you skip the sides (rice/pasta take time to boil).</p>

        <h2>1. Rotisserie Chicken is Your Best Friend</h2>
        <p>Buy a pre-cooked chicken from the grocery store. Eat the legs for dinner. Shred the breast for lunch salad
            tomorrow. Use the carcass to make bone broth. 3 meals, $6, zero cooking.</p>

        <h2>2. Frozen Veggies</h2>
        <p>Washing and chopping broccoli is a pain. Steam-in-bag frozen veggies are ready in 4 minutes. They are just as
            nutritious as fresh.</p>

        <h2>3. The "Charcuterie" Dinner</h2>
        <p>Too tired to use the stove? Put a pile of salami, cheese cubes, almonds, and pickles on a plate. Call it
            "Girl Dinner" or "Charcuterie." It's low-carb, requires zero effort, and tastes fancy.</p>

        <h2>4. Instant Pot / Slow Cooker</h2>
        <p>Throw a pork shoulder or chuck roast in the slow cooker with salt and spices before work. Come home to hot,
            shreddable meat.</p>
