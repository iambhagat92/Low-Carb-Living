        <p>There is a misconception that you need to buy grass-fed ribeyes and organic avocados to do low-carb. False.
            You can lose weight on "Walmart Keto" just as easily.</p>

        <h2>1. Eggs are the Ultimate Superfood</h2>
        <p>At roughly $0.20 per egg, they are the cheapest protein source on earth. An omelet for dinner is delicious
            and costs less than $1.</p>

        <h2>2. Choose Fatty Cuts (They are Cheaper!)</h2>
        <p>Chicken breasts are expensive and dry. Chicken thighs/drumsticks are cheap and juicy. 80/20 ground beef is
            cheaper than 90/10 lean beef. Fat is energy—don't pay extra to have it removed!</p>

        <h2>3. Frozen > Fresh</h2>
        <p>Fresh spinach rots in 3 days. Frozen spinach lasts months and costs half as much. Stock up your freezer with
            broccoli, cauliflower, and green beans.</p>

        <h2>4. Buy in Bulk</h2>
        <p>Buy the massive block of cheddar cheese and grate it yourself. Buy the family pack of meat and freeze what
            you don't use.</p>
