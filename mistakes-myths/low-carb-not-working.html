        <p>You have cut the carbs. You are eating the meat. But nothing is happening. It's incredibly disheartening. But
            biology is cause and effect. If the effect isn't happening, the cause isn't quite right.</p>

        <h2>1. Insulin Resistance</h2>
        <p>If you have been overweight for a long time, your baseline insulin might be very high. Even a small amount of
            carbs might be too much for you right now. You might need to be stricter (closer to 20g carbs) to see
            results.</p>

        <h2>2. Dairy Sensitivity</h2>
        <p>Dairy protein (casein) scares up insulin in some people just like sugar does. Try 2 weeks completely
            dairy-free (no cheese, no cream). Many people see a sudden "whoosh" of weight loss.</p>

        <h2>3. Sweeteners</h2>
        <p>Even though Stevia has 0 calories, the sweet taste on your tongue can sometimes trigger an insulin release in
            the brain (the Cephalic Phase Response). Try cutting all sweeteners and sodas, even diet ones.</p>

        <h2>4. Patience</h2>
        <p>Sometimes, your body is healing inside (fixing fatty liver, reducing inflammation) before it drops weight.
            Give it time.</p>
