        <p>This is controversial. We've been told "an apple a day keeps the doctor away." But modern fruit has been bred
            to be massive and incredibly sweet. Fruit is essentially nature's candy. It contains fructose, a sugar that
            goes straight to the liver.</p>

        <h2>The Rule of Thumb</h2>
        <p>If you are strict Keto, fruit is very limited. If you are general low-carb, you have more flexibility.</p>

        <div class="green-list">
            <h3>YES (In Moderation)</h3>
            <p><strong>Berries:</strong> Raspberries, blackberries, and strawberries range from 5-8g of carbs per cup.
                They are low in sugar and high in fiber.</p>
            <p><strong>Avocado/Olives:</strong> Yes, they are fruits! Eat as much as you want.</p>
            <p><strong>Lemons/Limes:</strong> Great for flavoring water.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="red-list">
            <h3>NO (Avoid for Weight Loss)</h3>
            <p><strong>Bananas:</strong> One banana has ~25g of sugar. That's your whole day's allowance.</p>
            <p><strong>Grapes:</strong> Pure sugar bombs.</p>
            <p><strong>Mango/Pineapple:</strong> Very high fructose content.</p>
            <p><strong>Dried Fruit:</strong> Raisins/dates are basically candy. Avoid.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="cta">
            <h3>What About Rice?</h3>
            <p>Fruit is tricky, but grains are usually clearer. See <a href="can-you-eat-rice-low-carb.html">Can You Eat
                    Rice on Low-Carb?</a>.</p>
