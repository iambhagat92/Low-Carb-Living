        <p>Low-carb is simple, but simple doesn't mean easy. There are nuances that can trip you up.</p>

        <h2>1. Eating Too Many Calories</h2>
        <p>Low-Carb is not magic. If you eat 5,000 calories of bacon and cheese, you will gain weight. You don't need to
            obsessively count, but you can't eat with abandon.</p>

        <h2>2. Eating Constant "Keto" Desserts</h2>
        <p>Almond flour and sweeteners are fine treats, but they are still calorie bombs. If you are stalling, cut the
            treats and eat real meat and veg.</p>

        <h2>3. Not Sleeping Enough</h2>
        <p>Sleep deprivation raises cortisol and ghrelin (hunger hormone). You will crave carbs if you are tired.</p>

        <h2>4. Obsessing Over Ketone Numbers</h2>
        <p>Higher ketones do not equal higher weight loss. Don't chase a number on a pee strip. Chase results in the
            mirror.</p>
