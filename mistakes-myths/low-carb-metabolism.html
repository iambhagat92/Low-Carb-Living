        <p>A common fear is "starvation mode." People worry that if they diet, their body will shut down and they will
            never burn calories again. The reality of low-carb is actually the opposite.</p>

        <h2>Calorie Restriction vs. Hormone Optimization</h2>
        <p>In a traditional "eat less, move more" diet, you are hungry. Your body senses a famine. It lowers your body
            temperature and slows you down to conserve energy. This is why you get cold and tired.</p>
        <p>In a low-carb diet, you are eating plenty of calories from fat. Your body doesn't think there is a famine. It
            has plenty of fuel (both from food and your own body fat access). Studies show that low-carb dieters often
            burn roughly <strong>300 more calories per day</strong> at rest compared to low-fat dieters.</p>

        <h2>The Thermic Effect of Food</h2>
        <p>Low-carb diets are usually higher in protein. It takes a lot of energy to digest protein (20-30% of the
            calories in protein are burned just digesting it). Fat and carbs are much easier to digest. So eating steak
            literally revs up your engine.</p>
