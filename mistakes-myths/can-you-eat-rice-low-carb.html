        <p>Rice is a staple for billions of people. It's cheap, filling, and bland. But for weight loss on a low-carb
            diet?</p>

        <h2>The Short Answer: No.</h2>
        <p>Rice is almost 100% pure starch. Once it hits your saliva, it begins turning into sugar immediately. One cup
            of cooked white rice has about <strong>45 grams of carbs</strong>. That is your entire daily allowance in
            one small bowl, with zero nutritional benefit other than energy.</p>

        <h2>"But What About Brown Rice?"</h2>
        <p>Brown rice has fiber, right? Yes, but it still has about 40-42g of carbs per cup. The glycemic index is
            slightly lower, but the carb load is still massive. For a diabetic or someone trying to lose fat, brown rice
            is largely the same as white rice.</p>

        <h2>The Better Alternative: Cauliflower Rice</h2>
        <p>Before you roll your eyes—hear us out. Grated cauliflower, sautéed in butter or oil with salt, mimics the
            texture of rice perfectly. It absorbs the sauce of whatever curry or stir-fry you are eating. And it has
            about 3g of net carbs per cup.</p>
