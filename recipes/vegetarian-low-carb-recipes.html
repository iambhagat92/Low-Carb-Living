        <p>Low-carb diets are often associated with bacon and steak, but you absolutely do not need to eat meat to
            succeed. Vegetarians can thrive by focusing on dairy, eggs, nuts, and plant fats.</p>

        <div class="veg-tip">
            <strong>Pro Tip for Vegetarians:</strong> Since you aren't eating meat, you must ensure you get enough
            protein from eggs, cheese, and low-carb soy products to maintain muscle mass.

        <h2>1. Eggplant Pizza</h2>
        <p>Slice a large eggplant into thick rounds. Roast them until tender. Top with marinara sauce, mozzarella
            cheese, and basil. Broil until bubbly. All the pizza flavor, none of the crust carbs.</p>

        <h2>2. Shakshuka</h2>
        <p>A Middle Eastern classic. Poach eggs in a simmering sauce of tomatoes, olive oil, peppers, onion, and garlic.
            Spiced with cumin and paprika. Serve with avocado.</p>

        <h2>3. Alfredo Zoodles</h2>
        <p>Use a spiralizer to make zucchini noodles. Sauté them briefly. Toss in a homemade alfredo sauce (heavy cream,
            butter, parmesan cheese, garlic). Ideally served immediately so it doesn't get watery.</p>

        <h2>4. Caprese Salad with Avocado</h2>
        <p>Layers of fresh mozzarella, tomato slices, basil leaves, and avocado. Drizzle generously with olive oil and
            balsamic vinegar (use balsamic sparingly as it has some sugar).</p>
