        <p>Indian cuisine is famous for its rich sauces and spices, but it usually comes with a mountain of rice and
            naan. The good news? The best part (the curry) is often naturally low-carb if you skip the flour thickeners
            and sugar.</p>

        <h2>1. Palak Paneer (Spinach & Cheese)</h2>
        <p>This vegetarian classic is keto-gold. Cubes of paneer (a non-melting cheese) simmered in a pureed spinach
            sauce with cream, ginger, garlic, and garam masala. Serve it as a thick stew.</p>

        <h2>2. Butter Chicken (No Sugar)</h2>
        <p>Marinate chicken thighs in yogurt and spices. Grill or pan-fry. Simmer in a sauce made of tomato puree, heavy
            cream, butter, and fenugreek. Most restaurants add sugar, so making this at home is key to keeping it
            low-carb.</p>

        <h2>3. Cauliflower Biryani</h2>
        <p>Traditional biryani is all rice. Swap it for cauliflower rice! Sauté cauliflower rice with ghee, cumin seeds,
            cardamom, veggies, and meat. The cauliflower absorbs the spices beautifully.</p>

        <h2>4. Tandoori Chicken Legs</h2>
        <p>Score the chicken legs. Marinate overnight in Greek yogurt, lemon juice, turmeric, chili powder, and cumin.
            Bake at high heat or grill until slightly charred. Serve with mint chutney.</p>
