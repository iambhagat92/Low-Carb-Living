        <p>They say breakfast is the most important meal of the day. A standard breakfast of cereal, toast, or juice is
            a sugar bomb that spikes your insulin and leaves you crashing (and hungry) by 10 AM. A low-carb breakfast
            does the opposite: it fuels you with steady energy that lasts for hours.</p>

        <h2>The Egg Classics</h2>
        <p>Eggs are the perfect low-carb food. Roughly 1g of carbs and 6-7g of protein per egg.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Spinach & Feta Omelet:</strong> Rich, savory, and full of iron.</li>
            <li><strong>Bacon & Eggs:</strong> The classic combo is actually approved! Just skip the toast.</li>
            <li><strong>Egg Muffins:</strong> Whisk eggs with veggies and ham, pour into muffin tins, and bake.
                Grab-and-go for busy mornings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>No-Egg Options</h2>
        <p>Sick of eggs? You are not alone. Try these instead:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Greek Yogurt:</strong> Choose full-fat, plain yogurt. Add a handful of walnuts and a few
                raspberries. Stevia can add sweetness.</li>
            <li><strong>Chia Pudding:</strong> Mix chia seeds with almond milk and sweetener. Let it sit overnight in
                the fridge. It thickens into a pudding texture.</li>
            <li><strong>Coffee with Heavy Cream:</strong> Sometimes, you aren't hungry. A "fat" coffee (coffee blended
                with butter or MCT oil) can keep you full till lunch.</li>
            <li><strong>Smoked Salmon & Cream Cheese:</strong> Spread cream cheese on cucumber slices and top with
                salmon.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Weekend Treat</h2>
        <p><strong>Almond Flour Pancakes:</strong> You don't have to give up pancakes! Mix almond flour, eggs, cream
            cheese, and baking powder. Serve with sugar-free syrup.</p>
