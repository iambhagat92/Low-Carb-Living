        <p>There is a lot of misinformation out there. Much of it comes from old science or headlines designed to scare
            you. Let's clear the air and look at the facts.</p>

        <div class="myth-box">
            <span class="myth-title">Myth 1: You Need Carbs for Your Brain</span>
            <p><strong>The Truth:</strong> Your brain actually runs incredibly well on ketones! It is a cleaner-burning
                fuel source that many people find improves their focus.</p>
            <p>While the brain does need a <em>tiny</em> amount of glucose, your body can produce all of it from protein
                through a cool process called gluconeogenesis. You do not need to eat sugar to feed your brain.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="myth-box">
            <span class="myth-title">Myth 2: It's Sustainable only for Meat Eaters</span>
            <p><strong>The Truth:</strong> You can be low-carb and vegetarian or even vegan. While meat makes it easier,
                plenty of plant fats (avocado, nuts, oils) and proteins (tofu, eggs, cheese) fit perfectly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="myth-box">
            <span class="myth-title">Myth 3: You Lose Muscle</span>
            <p><strong>The Truth:</strong> Quite the opposite. Ketones are "muscle-sparing." As long as you eat adequate
                protein, your body prefers to burn stored fat for fuel rather than breaking down muscle tissue.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="myth-box">
            <span class="myth-title">Myth 4: All That Fat Makes You Fat</span>
            <p><strong>The Truth:</strong> Dietary fat only makes you fat if you eat it <em>with</em> high carbs. When
                insulin is low (due to low carbs), dietary fat is burned for energy, not stored.</p>
