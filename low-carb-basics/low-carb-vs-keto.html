        <p>You’ll often hear "low-carb" and "keto" used interchangeably, but they aren't quite the same thing. Think of
            Keto as a very specific, strict version of a low-carb diet. All Keto diets are low-carb, but not all
            low-carb diets are Keto.</p>
        <p>Understanding the distinction can help you choose the path that fits your lifestyle best. Both offer great
            weight loss benefits, but the rules differ significantly.</p>

        <h2>The Ketogenic Diet (Keto)</h2>
        <p>This is the stricter sibling. The primary goal of standard Keto is to reach a metabolic state called
            "Ketosis," where your body runs almost entirely on ketones (broken down fat) rather than glucose.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Carb Limit:</strong> Very Low. Usually under 20g-50g of net carbs per day.</li>
            <li><strong>Fat Intake:</strong> High. Fat makes up 70-75% of your calories.</li>
            <li><strong>Fruits:</strong> Mostly restricted (berries only).</li>
            <li><strong>Tracking:</strong> Required. You need to count macros carefully to stay in ketosis.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Best For: Rapid weight loss, therapeutic benefits (epilepsy, diabetes management), and those who love
                data and structure.</em></p>

        <h2>General Low-Carb Diet</h2>
        <p>This is the more flexible approach. You reduce carbs enough to lower insulin and lose weight, but not
            necessarily enough to be in deep ketosis 24/7.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Carb Limit:</strong> Moderate. usually 50g to 100g (or even 150g) per day.</li>
            <li><strong>Fat Intake:</strong> Moderate. You eat fat to satisfy hunger, but don't need to chase high fat
                goals.</li>
            <li><strong>Fruits:</strong> More flexible. You can enjoy an apple, some berries, or a peach.</li>
            <li><strong>Tracking:</strong> Optional. Many succeed just by avoiding obvious starch and sugar.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Best For: Sustainable long-term lifestyle, maintaining weight loss, athletes, and social
                flexibility.</em></p>

        <h2>Which Should You Choose?</h2>
        <p>If you have a lot of weight to lose or struggle with strong sugar cravings, <strong>Keto</strong> might be
            the better kickstart. The strictness helps kill cravings quickly.</p>
        <p>If you want a lifestyle you can stick to for 20 years easily, or if you find Keto too restrictive socially,
            <strong>General Low-Carb</strong> is fantastic. Many people start with Keto and transition to Low-Carb for
            maintenance.</p>
