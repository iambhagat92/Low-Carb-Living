        <p>This is the million-dollar question. There is no "one size fits all" number, but there are clear guidelines
            depending on your specific goals, activity level, and metabolic health.</p>
        <p>Finding your personal carb tolerance is key to long-term success. Too low, and you might burn out; too high,
            and the scale won't budge.</p>

        <h2>The Three Levels of Low-Carb</h2>

        <div class="level-box">
            <h3>1. Ketogenic (Strict): 0-20 grams</h3>
            <p><strong>Who is it for?</strong> People who need to lose a lot of weight, manage type 2 diabetes, or want
                therapeutic benefits.</p>
            <p><strong>What it looks like:</strong> Meat, cheese, fats, and leafy green veggies. No fruit (except maybe
                a few berries), no starch at all.</p>
            <p><strong>Result:</strong> Deep ketosis, rapid fat burning.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="level-box">
            <h3>2. Moderate Low-Carb: 20-50 grams</h3>
            <p><strong>Who is it for?</strong> Those who want steady weight loss but need a tiny bit more variety.</p>
            <p><strong>What it looks like:</strong> Plenty of veggies, some berries, maybe a few nuts. Still no bread or
                potatoes.</p>
            <p><strong>Result:</strong> Steady weight loss, easy to maintain socially.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="level-box">
            <h3>3. Liberal Low-Carb: 50-100 grams</h3>
            <p><strong>Who is it for?</strong> Weight maintenance, active people, or transitioning off a strict diet.
            </p>
            <p><strong>What it looks like:</strong> You can have small servings of starchy veggies (like sweet potato)
                or more fruit.</p>
            <p><strong>Result:</strong> Slow weight loss or maintenance.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Total vs. Net Carbs</h2>
        <p>You will hear people talk about "Net Carbs." This is simply the total carbohydrates minus the fiber.</p>
        <p><em>Example: An avocado has 17g total carbs but 13g of fiber. 17 - 13 = 4g Net Carbs.</em></p>
        <p>Because fiber is not digested and doesn't raise blood sugar, most low-carb dieters only count net carbs. This
            allows you to eat plenty of vegetables.</p>

        <div class="cta">
            <h3>Where to Start?</h3>
            <p>We recommend starting at <strong>under 50g per day</strong>. It's a great middle ground. Not sure how to
                plan that? Try our <a href="low-carb-diet-7-day-plan.html">7-Day Start Plan</a>.</p>
