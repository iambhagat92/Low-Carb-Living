        <p>Even with the best intentions, it's easy to slip up. You cut out the bread and pasta, but the scale isn't
            moving, or you feel terrible. You might be falling into one of these common traps.</p>

        <div class="mistake-box">
            <h2>1. Fearing Fat</h2>
            <p><strong>The Mistake:</strong> You cut carbs, but you are still afraid of fat, so you eat lean chicken and
                broccoli. </p>
            <p><strong>The Fix:</strong> Energy has to come from somewhere! If you cut carbs AND fat, you are basically
                starving. You will be hungry, tired, and will eventually quit. Eat the butter, the steak, and the olive
                oil. Fat keeps you full.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mistake-box">
            <h2>2. Not Replacing Electrolytes</h2>
            <p><strong>The Mistake:</strong> You feel dizzy, have a headache, or get brain fog (the "Keto Flu").</p>
            <p><strong>The Fix:</strong> Low-carb diets are diuretic; you lose a lot of water and salt. This isn't sugar
                withdrawal; it's salt deficiency! Salt your food liberally and drink water.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mistake-box">
            <h2>3. Eating Too Many "Keto Treats"</h2>
            <p><strong>The Mistake:</strong> You are eating low-carb cookies, bars, and fake breads all day.</p>
            <p><strong>The Fix:</strong> These processed foods are often full of fiber fillers and sweeteners that can
                stall weight loss and keep cravings alive. Prioritize real food (meat, eggs, veg) for 90% of your diet.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mistake-box">
            <h2>4. Snacking All Day</h2>
            <p><strong>The Mistake:</strong> You eat huge amounts of almonds and cheese between meals.</p>
            <p><strong>The Fix:</strong> Calories still matter. Nuts and cheese are very calorie-dense. Plus, constant
                eating keeps insulin elevated. Try to stick to distinct meals.</p>
