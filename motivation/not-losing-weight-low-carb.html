        <p>It’s frustrating. You cut the carbs, you said no to the cake, but your weight has been the same for two
            weeks. Before you quit, let's troubleshoot. Stalls are common, and there is usually a logical explanation.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Carb Creep</h2>
        <p>Are you <em>actually</em> eating low-carb? Sauces, condiments, and "sugar-free" treats often have hidden
            carbs. A splash of milk in your coffee or a few extra tomatoes can add up. Track your food for 3 days to be
            sure.</p>

        <h2>2. Too Much Cheese and Nuts</h2>
        <p>These are low-carb, but they are incredibly calorie-dense. A handful of almonds is 170 calories. If you eat 3
            handfuls, that's a meal's worth of energy. Dairy (cheese/cream) also contains insulin-spiking proteins.</p>

        <h2>3. Stress and Sleep</h2>
        <p>Cortisol (the stress hormone) can pause weight loss. If you are sleeping 5 hours a night and stressed at
            work, your body will hold onto fat as a survival mechanism. Sleep is just as important as diet.</p>

        <h2>4. You Are Losing Fat, but Gaining Muscle</h2>
        <p>If you have started exercising, you might be building muscle while burning fat. The scale stays the same, but
            your body composition is changing. Use a tape measure, not just the scale.</p>
