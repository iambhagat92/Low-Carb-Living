        <p>The first week of a diet is easy. You are excited, the fridge is stocked, and you are ready to change your
            life. Then Week 3 hits. The scale stalls. You're tired. A coworker brings donuts.</p>
        <p>Motivation is not a constant state; it's a fluctuating emotion. You cannot rely on it. You need systems and
            mindset shifts.</p>

        <div class="quote">
            "Motivation is what gets you started. Habit is what keeps you going."
        </div>

        <h2>1. Find Your "True" Why</h2>
        <p>Wanting to "look good in jeans" is a weak why. It vanishes when you see a pizza. You need a deep, emotional
            reason.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"I want to have the energy to play with my kids without getting winded."</li>
            <li>"I want to get off my blood pressure medication."</li>
            <li>"I want to avoid the diabetes that affects my parents."</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Write this down. Look at it every morning.</p>

        <h2>2. Focus on Non-Scale Victories (NSVs)</h2>
        <p>The scale is a liar. It measures water, muscle, food volume, and poop. It doesn't just measure fat. Instead
            of obsessing over the number, look for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Loose rings or watch straps.</li>
            <li>Better sleep quality.</li>
            <li>Clearer skin.</li>
            <li>Constant energy levels.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Take Progress Photos</h2>
        <p>You see yourself in the mirror every day, so you don't notice the changes. A photo never lies. Take one every
            2 weeks in the same lighting. You will be shocked at the difference in 3 months.</p>

        <div class="cta">
            <h3>Stuck on the Scale?</h3>
            <p>If the number really isn't moving, there might be a reason. Read <a
