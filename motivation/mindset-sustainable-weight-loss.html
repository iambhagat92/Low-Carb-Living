        <p>You cannot hate yourself into a version of yourself you love. Sustainable weight loss comes from a place of
            self-care, not self-punishment.</p>

        <h2>1. Stop "dieting"</h2>
        <p>A diet has a start and an end date. A lifestyle does not. Stop saying "I can't eat that." Start saying "I
            don't eat that." It's a small shift that signals identity change.</p>

        <h2>2. Focus on Addition, Not Subtraction</h2>
        <p>Instead of thinking about all the bread you are missing, focus on adding things. "I am going to add a
            delicious steak and buttery asparagus to my dinner." It feels indulgent rather than restrictive.</p>

        <h2>3. The 80/20 Rule</h2>
        <p>Perfection is the enemy of good. If you slip up and eat a slice of pizza, don't say "Well, the day is ruined,
            I'll eat the whole pie." Just get back on track with the next meal. One flat tire doesn't mean you slash the
            other three tires.</p>

        <h2>4. Patience is Key</h2>
        <p>You didn't gain the weight in a month; you won't lose it in a month. Give yourself a year.</p>
