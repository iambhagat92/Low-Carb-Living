        <p>A "plateau" is technically defined as <strong>no weight change for 3 weeks or more</strong>. If it has been 4
            days, relax. But if it has been a month, here is how to shake things up.</p>

        <h2>1. Cut the Dairy and Nuts</h2>
        <p>Dairy and nuts are the most common stalling foods. They are easy to overeat and can cause inflammation in
            some people. Try cutting them out completely for 2 weeks. Stick to meat, eggs, and veggies.</p>

        <h2>2. Try Intermittent Fasting (IF)</h2>
        <p>Shrink your "eating window." If you usually eat from 8 am to 8 pm, try eating only between 12 pm and 8 pm
            (skipping breakfast). This lowers insulin levels for longer periods, encouraging fat burning.</p>

        <h2>3. Monitor Your Alcohol</h2>
        <p>Alcohol pauses fat burning. Your liver has to process the alcohol before it can go back to burning fat. If
            you are drinking a glass of wine every night, stop for a while.</p>

        <h2>4. Change Your Exercise</h2>
        <p>If you only do cardio, start lifting weights. Building muscle increases your daily calorie burn.</p>
