        <p>You’ve seen the ads: "Lose 20lbs in One Week!" That is biologically impossible (unless you chop off a leg).
            Low-carb is fast, but let's be real about the timeline.</p>

        <div class="timeline-box">
            <h2>Week 1: The "Whoosh" (5-10 lbs)</h2>
            <p>You step on the scale and you've lost 8 lbs! Is it fat? sadly, no. It's water. Carbs hold water. When you
                cut carbs, your kidneys flush out the bloat. You will look leaner, but you haven't burned much fat yet.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-box">
            <h2>Weeks 2-4: The Adaptation (1-2 lbs per week)</h2>
            <p>Weight loss slows down. Your body is learning to burn fat. You might feel tired. Stick with it. This is
                normal healthy fat loss.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-box">
            <h2>Month 2 onwards: The Steady Burn (0.5-2 lbs per week)</h2>
            <p>This is sustainable. 1lb of fat is 3,500 calories. Losing 1-2 lbs a week is excellent progress. Over a
                year, that is 50-100 lbs!</p>
        </div>
