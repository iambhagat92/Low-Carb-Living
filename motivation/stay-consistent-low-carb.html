        <p>Consistency beats intensity. It is better to be 80% perfect for a year than 100% perfect for two weeks. The
            key to consistency is removing the feeling of "deprivation."</p>

        <h2>1. Hack Your Favorite Foods</h2>
        <p>Don't say goodbye to pizza; say hello to Fathead Pizza (almond flour cheese dough). Don't mourn pasta;
            embrace Zoodles. We live in a golden age of low-carb alternatives. Use them!</p>

        <h2>2. Meal Prep</h2>
        <p>You only make bad decisions when you are hungry and have no plan. If you have a fridge full of cooked chicken
            and hard-boiled eggs, you will eat them. Make the right choice the easy choice.</p>

        <h2>3. Focus on What You CAN Eat</h2>
        <p>Instead of "I can't have bread," think "I can have steak with garlic butter." Low-carb food is decadent.
            Focus on the luxury of the diet.</p>

        <h2>4. Allow "Planned" Indulgences</h2>
        <p>If it's your birthday, have a small slice of cake. Enjoy it. Then, immediately go back to low-carb the next
            meal. Do not let one meal turn into a "cheat week."</p>
