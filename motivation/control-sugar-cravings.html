        <p>Sugar addiction is real. When you quit sugar, your brain screams for a dopamine hit. The good news is that
            these cravings usually disappear after 2 weeks of strict low-carb eating. Here is how to survive those 2
            weeks.</p>

        <h2>1. Eat More Salt</h2>
        <p>Often, a sugar craving is actually a salt craving masking itself. When your sodium levels drop (common in
            low-carb), your brain signals "NEED REWARD." Try drinking a cup of salty bone broth or putting a pinch of
            salt on your tongue.</p>

        <h2>2. Use Sour Foods</h2>
        <p>Sour flavors can "shock" your palate and reset your taste buds.
        <ul>
            <li>Drink water with lemon juice/apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li>Eat a pickle.</li>
            <li>Chew on a piece of lemon zest.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>3. Eat Enough Fat</h2>
        <p>If you are hungry, you will crave sugar. Fat is satiating. If a craving hits, eat a spoonful of coconut oil
            or a piece of full-fat cheese. It kills hunger instantly.</p>

        <h2>4. L-Glutamine</h2>
        <p>Some people swear by the amino acid L-Glutamine. Taking a supplement (on your tongue) can short-circuit sugar
            cravings in the brain.</p>
