        <h1>Low-Carb Survival Guide: Healthy Snacks for Work & Travel</h1>

            alt="Healthy meal prep container with vegetables and protein">

        <p>It’s easy to stick to a diet when you are in your own kitchen. You control the ingredients, the portions, and
            the timing. But the moment you step out the door, chaos ensues.</p>

        <p>The office vending machine is a minefield of sugar and processed carbs. Airports are endless corridors of
            pretzels and Cinnabon. Even the "healthy" options at gas stations are often candy bars in disguise.</p>

        <p>But failing to plan doesn't mean you have to fail your diet. With a simple strategy and a few "emergency
            snacks," you can navigate any environment without breaking ketosis. Here is your ultimate guide to staying
            low-carb on the go.</p>

        <h2>The Office Drawer Essentials (Non-Perishable)</h2>
        <p>Your desk drawer is your first line of defense against the breakroom donut box. Stock it with these
            shelf-stable heroes that can live there for months.</p>

        <div class="snack-box">
            <h3>1. Canned Fish (Sardines, Tuna, Mackerel)</h3>
            <p><strong>Why:</strong> The perfect protein-fat ratio. Rich in Omega-3s.</p>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Buy cans with "easy-open" lids so you don't need a can opener. Be mindful of the
                smell—maybe eat this in the breakroom, not at your cubicle!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="snack-box">
            <h3>2. Nut Butters (Squeeze Packs)</h3>
            <p><strong>Why:</strong> Brands like Justin's or Artisana make single-serve squeeze packs of almond or
                coconut butter.</p>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Check the ingredients. It should just say "Almonds" or "Almonds, Oil, Salt." No
                palm sugar or honey.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="snack-box">
            <h3>3. Beef Jerky / Meat Sticks</h3>
            <p><strong>Why:</strong> Pure protein that keeps you full for hours.</p>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Avoid Teriyaki or BBQ flavors (loaded with sugar). Stick to "Original" or "Spicy."
                Brands like Chomps or Epic are reliable.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="snack-box">
            <h3>4. 90% Dark Chocolate</h3>
            <p><strong>Why:</strong> Sometimes you just need something sweet. A square of 90% Lindt chocolate has
                virtually no sugar.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Office Fridge Stash</h2>
        <p>If you have access to a communal fridge (and trust your coworkers not to steal your food), your options
            expand significantly.</p>

        <ul class="list-group">
            <li><strong>Heavy Whipping Cream:</strong> Keep a small carton to make your office coffee creamy and
                filling.</li>
            <li><strong>String Cheese:</strong> Pre-portioned and fun to eat. Mozzarella or Cheddar sticks are
                zero-carb.</li>
            <li><strong>Hard-Boiled Eggs:</strong> Boil a dozen on Sunday and bring 2-3 to work each day. Nature's
                multivitamin.</li>
            <li><strong>Pickles:</strong> A jar of pickles provides a salty, crunchy satisfying snack with zero
                calories.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The "Gas Station" Survival Guide</h2>
        <p>You are on a road trip, you are starving, and the only thing for 50 miles is a gas station. Don't panic. You
            can build a surprisingly decent low-carb meal here.</p>

        <h3>✅ What to Buy:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pork Rinds (Chicharrones):</strong> The holy grail of road trip snacks. Crunchy, salty, and zero
                carb.</li>
            <li><strong>Peanuts/Almonds:</strong> Look for the "Blue Diamond" tins. Avoid the "Honey Roasted" ones.</li>
            <li><strong>Cheese Sticks:</strong> Most gas stations sell individual sticks of string cheese or Colby Jack.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Hot Dogs (Bunless):</strong> If they have a roller grill, grab two hot dogs and toss the buns.
                It's processed meat, but it's low-carb.</li>
            <li><strong>Sunflower Seeds:</strong> Great for keeping you awake while driving.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <h3>⚠️ RED FLAGS: Avoid These "Keto" Traps</h3>
            <p><strong>"Protein Bars":</strong> Most generic protein bars (like Clif or Gatorade bars) have 20g+ of
                sugar. They are candy bars with protein powder.</p>
            <p><strong>"Gluten-Free" Snacks:</strong> Gluten-free usually means "made with rice flour or potato starch."
                That is pure carbohydrate.</p>
            <p><strong>Beef Jerky (Sweet Flavors):</strong> Always read the label. Some commercial brands have 10g of
                sugar per serving.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>TSA-Friendly Travel Snacks</h2>
        <p>Flying is stressful enough without being hungry. Airport food is overpriced and carb-heavy (sandwiches,
            pizza, bagels). Pack your own.</p>

        <p><strong>The "Solids" Rule:</strong> TSA allows solid food through security. You can bring:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sliced cheese and pepperoni in a Ziploc bag.</li>
            <li>Avocados (bring a plastic knife or spoon).</li>
            <li>Macadamia nuts or walnuts.</li>
            <li>Cooked bacon (yes, really).</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>The Water Bottle Trick:</strong> Bring an empty water bottle through security and fill it at a
            fountain. Hydration is key to avoiding false hunger signals.</p>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Snacking should be the exception, not the rule. Ideally, your main meals should keep you full. But life
            happens. Meetings run late, flights get delayed, and traffic jams occur.</p>

        <p>By keeping this "survival kit" in your desk or glovebox, you ensure that you never have to choose between
            your health and your hunger.</p>
